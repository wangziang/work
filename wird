Summary
This a presentation of course work for Coursera Inferential Statistics online course. In this study distribution
of 1000 mean vlues for sets containg 40 random exp onential distributions samples each. Results confirm that
means are normally distributed with their mean aproximating the theo retical mean and variance approaching
that of p oplation divided by the sample size. Calculation done using R 3.1.1 language on Windows 8 64bit
platform

```{r}
sim_number <- 1000
n <- 40
lambda = 0.2
set.seed(511)
x <- replicate(sim_number, mean( rexp(40, rate=lambda)))
```

Results
1. Show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the
distribution. Expected sample mean
X¯ = σ = 1
λ
1/0.2 = 5
Calculated simulated sample mean

```{r, echo=FALSE}
smean <- sum(x) / sim_number
smean
```
## [1] 4.967
2. Show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
Expected value for sample variance
s 2 = σ2
n
=
( λ1 )2
n
=
1
λ2n
1/(0.22 ∗ 40) = 0.625
Calculated sample variance: s2n −1 =
n P i
=1
(x i −x¯) 2
n −1 =
```{r}
sum((x - smean)^2)/(sim_number-1)
```
## [1] 0.621
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal. Distribution density function looks approximately like a ‘bell’ shape:
```{r}
plot( density(x), main="Distribution density for samples mean")
abline(v=1/lambda, col="blue")
```
4. Evaluate the coverage of the confidence interval for λ1 :
X¯ ± 1.96 √Sn
To answer this question we just count number of sampled means out of 1000 simulations in CI, c.e. whose
distansce from the population mean 5 is in boundaries of the fomula value
```{r}
sum( abs(x - 1/lambda ) < 1.96 * smean / sqrt(n))
```
## [1] 951
which makes 95.1% of 1000 simulations.
